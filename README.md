## 📄 About the Project

**Assembly: Endgame** is a React-based web game inspired by the classic "Hangman." The objective is to guess a random word by selecting letters before all lives are lost.

While this project was part of the **"Learn React"** course from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e), it marks a significant milestone in my development journey: it is my **first largely independently developed React project**. Although the high-level requirements were provided, the implementation details, state logic, and architectural decisions were entirely my own.

### ✨ Key Features
* 🎮 Interactive UI with dynamic game state management.
* ⌨️ On-screen keyboard for user input.
* 🏆 Win/Loss logic with immediate visual feedback.
* 📱 Responsive design (playable on desktop & mobile).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Styling:** CSS
* **Build Tool:** Vite (or Create React App)

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

This project was more than just a coding exercise; it was a deep dive into **React State Management** and problem-solving.

* **Independent Implementation:** Unlike previous tutorials where I followed along with the code, this project required me to design the logic from scratch. This forced me to truly understand how React Hooks (like `useState` and `useEffect`) interact, rather than just applying them.
* **Critical Thinking & Scaling:** I learned to think critically about how to structure the application to ensure it remains scalable and maintainable. Decisions made early on (e.g., how to structure the data) had significant effects on later features.
* **Problem Solving:** I encountered bugs and edge cases that were specific to my implementation approach. Debugging and refactoring these "self-inflicted" challenges was one of the most valuable learning experiences of the entire project.
